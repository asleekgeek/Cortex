"""Integration tests for handlers.consolidation.write_class_backfill_pass
(M-D2, 7.4) — runs against the shared store wired by conftest (live PG /
``cortex_test`` when available; skipped otherwise, matching
test_memory_domain_backfill_pass.py's convention).

Covers what the pure core tests (test_write_class.py) cannot: the
SQL-level guarantees — the group-by-source bulk UPDATE, the
never-touch-an-explicit-non-default-value guard, and idempotence of a
full pass re-run.
