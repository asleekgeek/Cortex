"""Integration tests for handlers.consolidation.memory_domain_backfill_pass
(I6-D3) — runs against the shared store wired by conftest (live PG /
``cortex_test`` when available; skipped otherwise, matching the rest of
the handler-level test suite's convention).

Covers what the pure core tests cannot: the SQL-level guarantees —
non-overwrite of a non-empty domain, orphan tagging, and idempotence of
a full pass re-run.
