"""Bounded MCP responses — total payload budget with per-item truncation.

An MCP tool response that exceeds the host's tool-result ceiling is
rejected wholesale and dumped to a file (Claude Code behaviour, observed
2026-06-10: recall response of 324,429 chars rejected). Bounding must
therefore happen on our side of the wire, where we control which bytes
survive.

Historical budget derivation (not a current host-token guarantee):

- Claude Code enforces ``MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`` on MCP tool results.
  source: Claude Code 2.1.170 binary, extracted 2026-06-10 —
    default   ``d4O = 25000`` tokens,
    estimator ``Xz(text) = round(len(text) / 4)`` (4 chars/token),
    char cap  ``l4O() = limit * 4`` → 100,000 chars.
- The historical reproduction used the compact-JSON payload:
  ``len(json.dumps(payload, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False))``
  reproduced Claude Code's reported count exactly (324,429 == 324,429,
  measured 2026-06-10 on a rejected recall response).
- W4-4 audit, 2026-09-06: the locked MCP SDK now emits indented JSON;
  Claude Code 2.1.263 estimates UTF-16 length / 4, then may use its
  countTokens API above half the configured limit. Compact Python
  character length is neither that wire length nor the model token count.
  See docs/provenance/response-budget-audit.md for sources and the pending
  100-response calibration. Existing constants remain pending measurement.
- Safety factor 0.75 applied to the host cap. The host counts JS
  ``String.length`` (UTF-16 code units) while Python ``len()`` counts
  code points — non-BMP characters (emoji, rare CJK) count 2:1, so a
  payload filled exactly to the host cap can overshoot it. The factor
  guarantees no overshoot up to a 1/3 non-BMP code-point fraction
  (host_len = len × (1 + f) ≤ cap ⟺ f ≤ 1/3 at 0.75), far above any
  observed payload. source: ContextManager.swift budget logic
  (``reasoner.contextWindowSize * 0.75``), ai-prd-builder commit
  462de01 (2025-09-30) — same estimator-divergence guard, reused here
  per author direction.
- Secondary bound: ~1 MB MCP frame ceiling (measured 2026-04-23, see
  handlers/query_workflow_graph.py) — the Claude Code cap binds first.

Truncation policy: priority-weighted water-filling. A hard cap that
cuts all items equally destroys exactly the high-relevance content the
response exists to deliver, so the surviving budget is allocated
proportionally to each item's retrieval priority (``score`` from WRRF +
rerank fusion, ``heat`` for hot memories) and the least relevant slots
are condensed first. source: ContextDecomposer allocation algorithm,
ai-prd-builder commit 462de01 (2025-09-30) — "allocate remaining budget
proportionally across priority-ranked slots; condense
highest-priority-number [least important] slots first; iteratively
[shrink] the least important slot until the prompt fits". Adaptation:
slot priority = retrieval score (the system's own relevance estimate);
equal weights reduce to plain max-min fairness (the unweighted case).

Truncated items carry ``truncated: True`` plus ``content_length``
(original size) and keep their id, so truncation is never a dead end:
full content stays dynamically loadable by id (``recall`` ``memory_id``
+ ``content_offset`` args, ``wiki_read`` ``offset`` arg).
