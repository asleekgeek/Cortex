# ── Section catalogue for a file-doc page ──────────────────────────
#
# Every file-doc page should answer these questions. Each entry has:
#   - ``name`` — slug used in frontmatter ``curation_gaps``.
#   - ``heading`` — the H2 the LLM should write under.
#   - ``probes`` — patterns that, if present in the body, signal the
#     section is covered. A page satisfies the section when at least
#     one probe hits — usually the heading itself plus content under it.
#   - ``min_chars_under_heading`` — extra signal: a heading present
#     but with under N chars of prose under it doesn't count as
#     covered (it's a placeholder skeleton).
#   - ``description`` — what the LLM should write under this heading.
